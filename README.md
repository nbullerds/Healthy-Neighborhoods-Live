## How to Run
1. In the ``Healthy-Neighborhoods-Live/static/js/`` folder, create a file called ``config.js``  
2. Go to https://www.mapbox.com/ and sign up for an API key. Copy that API key and place in in the ``config.js`` file in a variable called ``const API_KEY = "PUT YOUR KEY HERE";`` and save the file.
3. Run the website at https://nbullerds.github.io/Healthy-Neighborhoods-Live/templates/ (again, this won't work without implementing the above changes)
